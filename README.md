# Where doner got cheaper
##### Germany's popular streetfood doner kebab is not that cheap anymore. Prices have generally risen â€“ but in some places they went down. And the veggi version "voner" can be a cheaper alternative.

##### Using data from the delivery company Lieferando I showed how the average doner price in big German cities changed from July 2023 to January 2024.
##### Though there was a big public discussion about the rise of doner prices, it turned out that in Berlin the difference was not as big as I had expected. Also, in some cities the average price actually went down.
##### Besides, I was curious about the price difference between a normal doner and the veggi version for my zip code in Hamburg.

##### For this project I created my own website. I made my charts with datawrapper. For the firth graph I used data that was published by the company. For the second one I created my own small data set by hand.

##### Actually, I wanted to scrape the website lieferando.de. But this would not answer my question, because I wanted to compare data from last year to this year. I found a bigger data set on the internet with data from Google Reviews. If I had more time, I would have a closer look and try to recreate it. But I think that this kind of data also has a lot of uncertainties.
